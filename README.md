## 1. Introduction

Leanote, not just a notepad!
![leanote.png](leanote.png "")

**Highlighted Features**

* Note-taking made easy: Leanote incorporates a clean and intuitive interface, the `tinymce` rich-text editor and a dedicated *markdown* editor, making your writing/typing more efficient and enjoyable. For more advanced users, we even offer `Vim` and `Emacs` writing modes to help boost your writing speed to another level. 
* Knowledge management: The flexible and versatile notebook-note-tagging system of Leanote makes it an ideal tool for knowledge management.
* Sharing: Share your knowledge, thoughts and experiences with friends via Leanote. Invite your friends to join your notepad in the cloud.
* Cooperating: Collaborate with colleagues to improve skills, fertilize ideas and brainstorm on the fly.
* Blogging: Publish your work and make Leanote your personal blog.

**Other Features**

* Markdown syntax support
* Distraction-free writing mode
* `Vim` and `Emacs` editing mode
* Export notes to PDFs
* Batch note operation
* Customizable themes for blogging

## 2. Why we create Leanote

We have been using the popular note-taking software/service `Evernote` as our knowledge management tool on a daily basis. Benefited from and inspired by `Evernote`, we decided to create a brand-new tool that provides everything `Evernote` has to offer, plus a bunch of new features that `Evernote` failed to deliver, such as:

* A more powerful editor: `Evernote`'s editor lacks the functionalities of **document navigation**, **syntax based code rendering** (as a programmer, syntax highlighted code rendering is a necessity), **image resizing** and so forth.
* Everybody loves *markdown*, however `Evernote` simply wouldn't add it despite of years' of requests from users. So we will do the favor and bring a *markdown* enabled editor to you, guess what, it is also rendered in real-time!
* If you a developer and miss the `Vim` or `Emacs` ways of writing, we offer you the choice of `Vim` and `Emacs` editing modes. Equipped with *markdown* syntax for text formatting, you will never need to touch your mouse while writing.
* We love managing knowledge and thoughts as much as sharing them, so everybody has their own note account (`Evernote`, `Onenote`, `Google doc`, `Wiz note` etc.) and social media account (`Facebook`, `Wordpress`, blogs, etc.). But why can’t those two be one? Leanote makes this first step to bridge the private note-taking and public knowledge sharing seamlessly.
* A complete and all-platform (sorry Windows phone) covering software suite: that includes Leanote Web & Server (this repository), [Desktop app](https://github.com/leanote/desktop-app), [iOS](https://github.com/leanote/leanote-ios), [Android](https://github.com/leanote/leanote-android). And they are all open source!
